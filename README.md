# Machine Learning Classifiers
For this project I will be working on the CIFAR-10 dataset described here: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Specfically, I am building a classifier using all three of:
- Multinomial logistic regression
- Random Forest
- Convolutional Neural Net

I will then explore the accuracy of each classifier and compare them.
Check my work out by previewing the Analysis On Different Classifiers.ipynb file!
